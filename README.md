## 🚀 Revolutionizing Code Understanding for Developers and AI
CloudContext is a powerful SaaS platform that transforms how developers, teams, and AI systems interact with codebases. By automating context generation and delivering in-depth insights, we enable you to understand and manage even the most complex projects with ease.

CloudContext is a powerful platform that delivers automated project intelligence to developers, teams, and AI systems. It streamlines metadata and analysis, enabling **full codebase awareness** in seconds.

## 🔑 Key Features:
- **Tech Stack Analysis:** Quickly identify the frameworks, tools, and languages in your project.
- **API Usage Mapping:** Understand how your app interacts with internal and external services.
- **Dependency Tracking:** Spot vulnerabilities, outdated libraries, and circular imports effortlessly.
- **File Summaries:** AI-generated insights for faster onboarding and collaboration.
- **Code Quality Metrics:** Stay on top of lint issues, complexity, and maintainability.
- **Environment Variables Overview:** Keep track of critical configurations across environments.

## 💼 Who is it For?
